# pro3. perform global|local alignment

## Description

* Write a Python script to perform a global or local alignment.
* Creating your own script, i.e. hw3.py.
* In this program, library Biostrings is only used to parse input fasta file.
* Packages you can use: numpy, pandas, Bio
* You should write a program with a function named alignment, ie.
```
def alignment(input_path, score_path, output_path, aln, gap):
    .
    .
    .
    .
```
* hw3_ref.py: You can start from this reference code and try to write your own comment in English.
* If there is more than one local alignment with the same highest score, you should output local alignments with the maximum length. 
* If there is more than one local alignment with the same highest score and length, you should output those local alignments in string sequential order according to protein1 and then protein2, i.e., 
  ```
  >protein1
  local alignment1
  >protein2
  local alignment1
  >protein1
  local alignment2
  >protein2
  local alignment2
  ```
## Parameters

* input: .fasta file (ie. examples/test_global.fasta, examples/test_local.fasta)
* score: score file (ie. examples/pam100.txt, examples/pam250.txt)
* aln: global|local
* gap: gap score
* output: .fasta file. You should output your alignment in FASTA format (ie. examples/result_global.fasta, examples/result_local.fasta).
  
## Command

Executing your code with the following command.


```Python
alignment("examples/test_global.fasta", "examples/pam250.txt", "examples/result_global.fasta", "global", -10)
alignment("examples/test_local.fasta", "examples/pam100.txt", "examples/result_local.fasta", "local", -10)
```

## Evaluation

10 testing data(5 public, 5 private)

The correct answer gets 10 points for each testing data.


### Penalty

* High code similarity to others: YOUR SCORE = 0
